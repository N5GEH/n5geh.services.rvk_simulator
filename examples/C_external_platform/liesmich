C_external_platform

Examples of configuration for gateway running in artificial time and 
communicating with the platform of TU-Dresden along with authentication 
mechanism. It requires the platform to run on the domain 
http://fiware.n5geh.de 

The examples essentially mirror those of B_basic_platform. The only 
difference is the usage of the external platform and its configuration.

As for today, the functionality could not be tested. Therefore I am 
forced to give this task over to the next generation of researchers who 
will work on n5geh project.
